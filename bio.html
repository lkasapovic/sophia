            Bush was born in Pasadena, California.<br>
            She is the only child of Maureen and <br>
            Charles William Bush.[1] She graduated <br>
            from Westridge School for Girls in 2000, <br>
            where she was a member of the volleyball <br>
            team. At Westridge, she was required to <br>
            participate in the theatre arts program. <br>
            Bush stated: "Part of my school's requirement<br>
            was to do a play. I was really irritated because<br>
            I wanted to play volleyball and I had to go and do<br>
            this play. But there was a moment after the performance<br>
            when I realized I had gone and been somebody <br>
            else. I thought, 'If I could do this for the rest<br>
            of my life, I am set.' It was like love at first sight.<br>
            " At the age of 17, Bush was named the Tournament of <br>
            Roses Parade Queen. She attended the University of <br>
            Southern California (USC) as a journalism major until her <br>
            junior year, where she was a member and Social Chair of the <br>
            Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.</h3>
